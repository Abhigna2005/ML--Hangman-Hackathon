# Hackman AI: ML Hackathon Project

This repository contains the submission for the **UE23CS352A: Machine Learning Hackathon ("Hackman")**.  
The project is an intelligent **Hangman assistant** that uses a **hybrid model** to play the game efficiently, as required by the `Problem_Statement.pdf`.

---

##  Core Components

The solution is a **hybrid model** that combines **probabilistic reasoning** with **reinforcement learning**:

### **1. HangmanHMMOracle (The Oracle)**  
A **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** trained on a **50,000-word corpus (`corpus_clean_unique.txt`)**.  
It estimates the probability of the next letter based on:

- **Initial Probabilities:** The probability of a letter starting a word.  
- **Transition Probabilities:** The probability of one letter following another.

### **2. TrustOracleAgent (The Brain)**  
A **Q-Learning agent** that uses a generalized state and a *"Trust Oracle"* policy.  
It combines its learned **Q-values** with the **HMM's probabilities** to make the optimal guess.

##  How to Run the Project

### **1. Data Preprocessing (Run this first)**

1. Upload `ML_Data_preprocessing.ipynb`, `corpus.txt`, and `test.txt` to your environment (e.g., Google Colab).  
2. Run the `ML_Data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.  
   This will clean the data and produce:
   - `corpus_clean_unique.txt`  
   - `test.txt`  
   (These are required by the main program.)

---

### **2. Main Program**

1. Open `Hangman.ipynb` (or `Hangman_Project_Cleaned.ipynb`).  
2. Ensure the generated `corpus_clean_unique.txt` and `test.txt` are in the same directory.  
3. Run all cells in the notebook. This will:
   - Initialize the **HangmanHMMOracle**.  
   - Train the **TrustOracleAgent** for **10,000 episodes**.  
   - Save the Q-table as `trust_oracle_q_table.pkl`.  
   - Run two demo games (on *“hackathon”* and *“zygomorph”*).  
   - Run the full evaluation on `test.txt` and print the final score.
