Hackman AI: ML Hackathon Project

This repository contains the submission for the UE23CS352A: Machine Learning Hackathon ("Hackman").
The project is an intelligent Hangman assistant that uses a hybrid model to play the game efficiently, as required by the Problem_Statement.pdf.


Core Components

The solution is a hybrid model that combines probabilistic reasoning with reinforcement learning:

1. HangmanHMMOracle (The Oracle):
   A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on a 50,000-word corpus (corpus_clean_unique.txt).
   It estimates the probability of the next letter based on:

* Initial Probabilities: The probability of a letter starting a word.
* Transition Probabilities: The probability of one letter following another.

2. TrustOracleAgent (The Brain):
   A Q-Learning agent that uses a generalized state and a "Trust Oracle" policy.
   It combines its learned Q-values with the HMM's probabilities to make the optimal guess.


How to Run the Project

1. Data Preprocessing (Run this first):

   * Upload ML_Data_preprocessing.ipynb, corpus.txt, and test.txt to your environment (for example, Google Colab).
   * Run the ML_Data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
     This will clean the data and produce corpus_clean_unique.txt and test.txt, which are required by the main program.

2. Main Program:

   * Open Hangman.ipynb (or Hangman_Project_Cleaned.ipynb).
   * Ensure the generated corpus_clean_unique.txt and test.txt are in the same directory.
   * Run all cells in the notebook. This will:

     * Initialize the HangmanHMMOracle.
     * Train the TrustOracleAgent for 10,000 episodes.
     * Save the Q-table as trust_oracle_q_table.pkl.
     * Run two demo games (on "hackathon" and "zygomorph").
     * Run the full evaluation on test.txt and print the final score.
